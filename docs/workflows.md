# Workflows

## Direct mode

Free-form messages without a slash command use `lead` by default as a bounded router. This keeps the simplest path for small, clear, low-risk changes while avoiding silent guesses when the right flow is unclear.

Lead decides quickly between `developer`, `researcher`, `designer`, or `specifier`. It delegates small direct work to `developer`, routes uncertainty to `researcher`, visual/product work to `designer`, planning gaps to `specifier`, and asks the user when ambiguity changes the right path.

## Feature

`lead -> designer if applicable -> researcher -> specifier -> developer -> reviewer`

The lead decides whether design or research is needed. Specifier waits for relevant discovery. Developer waits for spec. Reviewer waits for diff.

## Plan

`lead -> researcher -> specifier -> reviewer`

Plan-only mode always starts with researcher, then specifier creates the implementation-ready plan, and reviewer audits the plan/spec without requiring a diff. It never invokes developer and allows only one correction pass before returning the plan with risks or a blocked state.

## Scope

`scoper -> researcher -> scoper synthesis -> specifier`

No design, implementation, or review.

## Design

`designer -> open-design`

Designer reads product/design docs, optionally uses Impeccable, then creates or runs an Open Design project.

## AHE

`evaluator -> debugger -> evolver -> lead approval -> developer -> evaluator -> debugger -> reviewer`

Only for improving the harness itself.

Harness-evolution evidence is classified in `opencode/docs/ai/harness/evidence.md`:

- `static_contract`: file and contract inspection.
- `transcript_replay`: `opencode run --format json --thinking` execution.
- `live_smoke`: real repo, app, browser, or runtime check.
- `manual_oracle`: documented human judgment.
