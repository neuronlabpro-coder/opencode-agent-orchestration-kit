# Workflows

## Direct mode

Free-form messages without a slash command use `developer` by default. This is intended for small, clear, low-risk changes where a full product-development pipeline would be unnecessary.

If the request has ambiguity, visual/product impact, medium or large scope, or critical missing context, switch to `/feature`, `/scope`, `/design`, or `/spec`.

## Feature

`lead -> designer if applicable -> researcher -> specifier -> developer -> reviewer`

The lead decides whether design or research is needed. Specifier waits for relevant discovery. Developer waits for spec. Reviewer waits for diff.

## Plan

`lead -> researcher -> specifier -> reviewer`

Plan-only mode always starts with researcher, then specifier creates the implementation-ready plan, and reviewer audits the plan/spec without requiring a diff. It never invokes developer and allows only one correction pass before returning the plan with risks or a blocked state.

## Scope

`scoper -> researcher -> scoper synthesis -> specifier`

No design, implementation, or review.

## Design

`designer -> open-design`

Designer reads product/design docs, optionally uses Impeccable, then creates or runs an Open Design project.

## AHE

`evaluator -> debugger -> evolver -> lead approval -> developer -> evaluator -> debugger -> reviewer`

Only for improving the harness itself.

Harness-evolution evidence is classified in `opencode/docs/ai/harness/evidence.md`:

- `static_contract`: file and contract inspection.
- `transcript_replay`: `opencode run --format json --thinking` execution.
- `live_smoke`: real repo, app, browser, or runtime check.
- `manual_oracle`: documented human judgment.
